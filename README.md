## Arduino and ESP Projects Repository

Welcome to the Arduino and ESP Projects repository! This repository contains various projects developed using Arduino and ESP microcontrollers. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find a range of projects here to explore, learn, and contribute to.

### About Arduino and ESP

Arduino and ESP are popular platforms for building embedded systems and IoT (Internet of Things) projects. Arduino boards are known for their simplicity and ease of use, making them ideal for beginners and hobbyists. ESP microcontrollers, especially those from the ESP8266 and ESP32 families, offer Wi-Fi connectivity and more advanced features, making them suitable for IoT applications.

### Project Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each representing a different project. Inside each project folder, you'll find the necessary source code, schematics (if applicable), and any additional resources needed to replicate or understand the project.
